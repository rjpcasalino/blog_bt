	<h3>Boring Tranquility</h3>
	<hr>
	<p><em>There is an ongoing -- albeit abated -- stream, which is all about its flow. We can learn much from the play of water upon the 
shore. Just seeing a gentle caress spreading liquid via the so numerous infinitesimal canyons of sand is enough. - Bernard Truman</em></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster">"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!"</a></p>
<p>I moved off EC2 and back to bare metal. On an old Samsung 1TB drive from 2008 this HTML file sits. How fast the Nix addiction spreads! 
I am running NixOS upon all my machines. Such are the actions of madmen! Well, that's not actually entirely true. I am not running Nix 
on my desktop box. Its anointment will come later as I get more comfortable cruising on my ThinkPad. NixOS has been such a joy. Ease 
of installation is a key indicator of a worthwhile distribution. Nix has that. I plopped down beside the makeshift workstation I had 
assembled in my office and surfed the information superhighway to the NixOS manual:</p>
<p>(Imagine, if you please, an American sitting on his home office sofa besides his cat.)
If imagination is not your bag, you can always scope out the <a href="static/asset/path">image</a>.</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p><em>UEFI</em></p>
<blockquote><p>parted /dev/sda -- mklabel gpt</p>
<p>parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary 512MiB -8GiB</p>
<p>parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary linux-swap -8GiB 100%</p>
<p><strong> Note: The swap partition size rules are no different than for other Linux distributions. </strong></p>
<p>parted /dev/sda -- mkpart ESP fat32 1MiB 512MiB</p>
<p>parted /dev/sda -- set 3 boot on</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>For legacy boot (remember that this can all be found in the manual as well!)</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>parted /dev/sda -- mklabel msdos</p>
<p>parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary 1MiB -8GiB</p>
<p>parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary linux-swap -8GiB 100%</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Format it</em></p>
<blockquote><p>mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/sda1</p>
<p>mkswap -L swap /dev/sda2</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>for UEFI systems</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>mkfs.fat -F 32 -n boot /dev/sda3</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>mount it</em></p>
<blockquote><p>mount /dev/disk/by-label/nixos /mnt</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>for UEFI</em></p>
<blockquote><p>mkdir -p /mnt/boot</p>
<p>mount /dev/disk/by-label/boot /mnt/boot</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>gen the config</em></p>
<blockquote><p>nixos-generate-config --root /mnt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit the file using nano (make sure you are editing the mounted config)</p>
<p><strong>do the install</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>nixos-install</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look to a commands man page to explain anything (e.g., flags) that you don't understand. Or, dare I say it, just Google it.</p>

<p>Odyssey continues its roll to release 0.0.1. Odyssey is a functional static site generator that allows templates to be written using 
<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">jinja</a>. It isn't powerful, it isn't that smart, but it works in what it is designed to do today. Odyssey was 
started with a desire to better understand Python. It's been a fun time thus far, so I plan to keep going. My true end goal is to have 
a simple, functional command line tool that allows a user to use the <code>odyssey start</code> cmd to spin up a https website (i.e., get certs 
from Let's Encrypt, spin up nginx). We'll see how far I can get. Odyssey gets its name from Home's 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2Nz9gdj35Unk1AbfL8Igmx?si=WhfO0FV1S4GC66_5GqhyxQ">Odyssey</a> and the idea that Odyssey attempts to take 
you on a splendid trip to places unknown.</p>

	<h3>Boring Tranquility</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>I read "Snow Crash" for the first time a few months ago. It was on my kindle. Here are
my highlights and notes (if any).</p>
<blockquote><p>They would take their software out and race it in the black desert of the electronic night.</p>
<p>The world is full of power and energy and a person can go far by just skimming off a tiny bit of it.</p>
<p>When Hiro learned how to do this, way back fifteen years ago, a hacker could sit down and write an entire piece of software by 
himself. Now, that’s no longer possible. Software comes out of factories, and hackers are, to a greater or lesser extent, 
assembly&gt;line workers. Worse yet, they may become managers who never get to write any code themselves.
note:
Programmers and hackers</p>
<p>Software development, like professional sports, has a way of making thirty-year-old men feel decrepit.</p>
<p>It was, of course, nothing more than sexism, the especially virulent type espoused by male techies who sincerely believe that they 
are too smart to be sexists.</p>
<p>To condense fact from the vapor of nuance.</p>
<p>And she, maybe, was beginning to think that if Hiro was so convinced in his own mind that he was unworthy of her, maybe he knew 
something she didn’t.</p>
<p>shopping carts performing their clashy, anal copulations.</p>
<p>onomatopoeic</p>
<p>He devoted himself to the common problem of sifting through vast amounts of irrelevant detail in order to find significant gems of 
information.</p>
<p>It’s created by the media in that without the media, people wouldn’t know it was here, Refus wouldn’t come out and glom onto it the 
way they do. And it sustains the media. It creates a lot of information flow—movies, news reports—you know.</p>
<p>Even the word ‘science’ comes from an Indo-European root meaning ‘to cut’ or ‘to separate.’ The same root led to the word ‘shit,’ 
which of course means to separate living flesh from nonliving waste. The same root gave us ‘scythe’ and ‘scissors’ and ‘schism,’ which 
have obvious connections to the concept of separation.</p>
<p>xenoglossy</p>
<p>Pentecost</p>
<p>When you first turn on a computer, it is an inert collection of circuits that can’t really do anything. To start up the machine, you 
have to infuse those circuits with a collection of rules that tell it how to function. How to be a computer. It sounds as though these 
me served as the operating system of the society, organizing an inert collection of people into a functioning system.</p>
<p>We have a huge workforce that is illiterate or alliterate and relies on TV—which is sort of an oral tradition.</p>
<p>And we have a small, extremely literate power elite—the people who go into the Metaverse, basically—who understand that information 
is power, and who control society because they have this semimystical ability to speak magic computer languages.</p>
<p>Jack the sound barrier. Bring the noise.</p>

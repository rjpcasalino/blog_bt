# I

There was never a more beautiful sight. There his wife stood beside a cherished childhood memory. The whiskey had already gone to his head; the weed kept his mind pacing and alive to the nonsense maelstrom that the whiskey had produced. In all that rush of mind data he had a brief daydream of youth.

In only a short second a millennia of pixels flashed. He saw it all very clearly: a jumble of half-truths and post hoc fabrications. It was rooted in mundane nostalgia. In this timeless dreamscape there was a car service business on the corner of Luquer & Court not too far from home. Standing in the far corner of that place was the machine. It gave off the faint golden electric glow currently in his wife's eyes. Business did not seem good. There were a few grown men sitting around on poorly padded metal chairs. The floor was linoleum and worn. He saw it. He will see it again. The golden glow saturates the air. "I see my wife," he thought. "I see my youth. I am there and I am not."

Around 13 or 14 now and MAME was a young software. He would spend his days searching all over that vast space net for Metal Slug ROMs. READ-ONLY MEMORY would flash in his mind, blinking endlessly and without regard. There was nothing surroudning that neonloop of light but the total empty space of black. 

This was SoHo, Manhattan in 2001. There were those before him that said things like "it's changing too fast", "there are too many people these days...", "all I really want is to go home". They were right about us and they're right about you, he would remind himself. In this sweet time of few worries he knew Metal Slug and Neo•Geo. It was through the hardware that the emulation was able to tangibly intermingle with everything beyond the metaphysical. He often thought how strife filled were people processing the "War on Terror", "OUR future as a people", and "The Way". Such trivialities bothered him little. He was angry without knowing way. Now, with time seemingly flowing backward as his mind ages, he cannot help but emit some unsound when he sees it for what it was: an act of war in the macro. Far too large a thing for one mind; it required a collective response of thought and idea. It made him seasick on air.

The crack of the rifle startles him back to waking life. There a faint tan mote rested before his eyes and no matter the amount of rubs his balled fists offered the mote would not yield.

In this place of unknowing he knew Anna. He recalled it all now: his first job at a startup in the city, his learning what it meant to finally call himself a "programmer", and all the ill defined moments that meant so much and so little all at once. He wanted scream that he was now done with it all, but it seemed to be a flaw of time logic to be at that point. He was now in the code/space he sometimes caught glimpes of in the random light play of sunny days. The fabric of space time felt so haphazard there then.

Cascading down the carnivorous memory cylinder the fabric finally tore when his relentlessly grasping fingers found a point to pearice. The whole facade came crashing down. When he was able to properly stand he thought how wonderful he felt and why shouldn't he get to feel that way every now and then?

 On my last day my workmates and I sloughed towards the dim glow of CRTs. It was strange to be a in place built to resemble a dream of youth. Corrugated corners, sticky floors, and vapors smelling of just delight. It was here in this place of hazed recollection that I saw it again.

There, in that moment, my handicapped mind flipped through its memory Rolodex to joysticks, CRTs, and Japanese video games.

Later that evening I rambled on and on about how cool it would be to have a Neo Geo MVS in our home. Anna dismissively agreed. We'd be too cool, just a couple of state of the art hipsters or something like that. She might have been chalking this all up to some drunken insanity. She can dream too.

It's strange to finally realize the exquisiteness of time and place. There's a sense of lifting the vail; a sight beyond normal sight. Perhaps beyond the CRT is Elysium. Beyond the sprites a truth and balance unknown.

Where do I go from here? Is there some part of me that desires to reach back into the ether of time and yank what once was and paste it in the here and now? I suppose so. There's now only the machine and time. A timeless machine standing ramrod and waiting.

Soda stains grace its sides, dust blankets its circuits, and rust accomulates on its metal fringes. There it stands ready to be passed again to another. 
I am standing in the entryway of a clapboard hosue. They air outside is crisp. I know there is a navel base not too far away. Nuclear weapons resting in silos
ready to dive to the depth of the ocean.

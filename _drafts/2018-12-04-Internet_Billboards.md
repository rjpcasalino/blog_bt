Our reality is redundant. We now have tiny TVs in our hands, which tell us how to live, whom to love, and what amounts to hate. Societal control is easier with smart phones.
There's an old joke that the internet is awe inspiring...and full of ads. Internet billboards are at every digital mile marker and every virtual off ramp.

Before there were internet billboards there was actual billboards (their still there!) - then there was the billboard in the movie house. A billboard ready to talk at
all the gawkers.

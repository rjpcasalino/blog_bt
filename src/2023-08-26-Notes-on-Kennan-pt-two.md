pt two

I share a middle name with one Joseph Noulens. Noulens who? Who the fuck (forgive my limited vocabulary) is Noulens? I'll tell you. But first, listen to him speak from the grave of 335 pages deep:

> The building was vast. We had to pass through a whole series of halls before, at the end of the corridor and under the shadow of a doorway, there appeared a little man with enormous head and with the slanting eyes of a [Tatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatars): it was Lenin. The face, dominating and powerful, was indeed that of a genius, but the semi-flat nose, the mouth and the chin gave him the disturbing aspect of a barbarian.

Noulens was the French ambassador and according to Soviet history he fled Russia after the failed assassination attempt of Lenin. History is so old. It goes on forever. Seemingly.

Harry Leinenweber can you hear me? It's time to let Larry Hoover go. Hoover. Herbert. Ah, our boy Herbert. He was a good man. Would he have put the [Japanese in cages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans)? Keep pace with me.

I'm so sorry I always get off track. Back to Lenin back, back to the past.

I find myself flipping through my Jack London and I miss him and O what I would give to meet him and Ye and see them collaborate!

But I gotta focus! I got Lenin on my mind. I see him standing with faux blood on his hands (some paint given to him by some fucking (again, that limited vocabulary) liberal) in the People's Republic of Fremont. You should see the place. It's like a fake SoHo or an attempt at the East Village. What's with these Soviet worshipers wanting to be New York. Trotsky spent less than a month in Manhattan and the moron went and got himself murdered by Stalin.

I spent so much time trying to Learn About Lenin. It's an industry, you must understand. God, I love Russians. I am so lost. Nah, I am not lost. I am clear and I walk the right path. I know this in the heart of my heart. I've spent some time Manhattan myself. I've seen the common people. I've seen every American. You walk on this land and you are an American like me. We are all Americans. The ancient Americans of the First Nations. They were and are Americans. They might not like that but I speak the truth!

Ah, I always forget about Nikolai Yezhov and that early photoshop work. Nice, nice Uncle Joe.

cURL POST request header checks and more in Bash:

- [-D, --dump-header <filename>](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html)

>"This option is handy to use when you want to store the headers that an HTTP site sends to you. Cookies from the headers could then be read in a second curl invocation by using the -b, --cookie option! The -c, --cookie-jar option is a better way to store cookies."

- [note the - after the -D which indicates that the output "file" is stdout.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10060342/5404826)

For many requests, use a loop:

	for i in "${IDS[@]}"
	do
		:
		if curl -D - -X POST www.google.com -o /dev/null | grep 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK'
	done

There's probably a more eloquent way to grep...

	curl -s -D - -X POST www.google.com -o /dev/null | head -n 1 | grep 200

### XML

`-d` = data and thus `<XML><Stuff><ID>'$1'</ID></Stuff></XML>`

`-H content-type: text/xml` is also needed.

bash functions that return interpolated strings:

	xml_return () {
		echo '<Foo xmlns="foobar" xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><Attendant><ID xmlns="foobar">'$1'</ID><ServiceStatus>CLEANING_STARTED</ServiceStatus></Foo>'
	}

keep the format by surrounding the parameter in single quotes.

Bash does not have hash maps, but it's doable. You know, this reminds me, I really need to read up on bash scripting...

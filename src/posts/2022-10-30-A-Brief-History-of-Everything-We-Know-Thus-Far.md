> Sometimes late at night when I'm bathed in the firelight and the moon comes calling a ghostly white and I recall  — 

that I love Bod Seger and one of his songs needs new life outside a truck ad, so here we go!

I got COVID-19 (or is it SARS‑CoV‑2?) a few months back (we will not forget [Li Wenliang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Wenliang)) and when I was sick with this virus of all viruses I read Andrew H. Knoll's fabulous book ["A Brief History of Earth"](https://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Earth-Billion-Chapters/dp/0062853910) and I told myself that today I would write about what I read and why I liked what I read. Does that not sound nice?

Anyhow,

Four billion years in eight chapters and I haven't picked up this book in months so I am trying to recall from memory what I did learn or why I wanted to read it in the first place. Okay, okay — something is coming back to me. [Stephen Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould) — I was really into his books over the summer and was really digging his writings on Darwin. Darwin, Darwin, Darwin. We must never forget his partner in crime: [Alfred Russel Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace) who was not a racist but an honest person in a bad time.

> I recall!

I needed a bit of science with my Freud (the great fraud!) whom I can't put down for long and now I see [Loren Eiseley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Eiseley) jump about my mind. What a wonderful mind his was! But I looked toward Harvard and found what I truly needed. I was waiting for Knoll to acknowledge Gould and he does at some point but I do recall that he takes his sweet ass time doing so but every man wants to be somebody so I get it. I marvel at these deep minds sometimes. How they can convey knowledge with such a crisp self-confidence or is it more smug self-confidence?

Anyway,

It's to Marsha for everything.

and mine is for _vrfc_.

# Prologue: An Invitation

A great overview of what we're about to experience! Lots of what I wish were color illustrations but I guess hardcovers are expensive to turn out and money must be saved!

> 20 years...where'd they go?

Gravity. It's what keeps us grounded! Ha, dad joke? Really. Come now.

What's Einstein got to say?

> "If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why does it fall to the ground?" The usual answer to this question is: "Because it is attracted by the earth."

> ... 

> The action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly. The earth produces in its surroundings a gravitational field, which acts on the stone and produces its motion of fall.

> ... 

> It is something like this: The body (e.g. the earth) produces a field in its immediate neighborhood directly; the intensity and direction of the field at points father removed from the body are thence determine by the law which governs the properties in space of the gravitational fields themselves. 

> ... 

> Bodies which are moving under the sole influence of a gravitational field receive an acceleration, _which does not in the least depend either on the material or on the physical state of the body_.

Home is _terra firma_. What else is terra? [_Terraform_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraform_\(software\)) is a silly piece of software and a way to always be ["Building Better Worlds"](https://alienanthology.fandom.com/wiki/Weyland-Yutani). Always be building better worlds! There is also _terra incognita_ but that's for another day.

<hr>

[Carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide), please explain that to a 3 year old. Easy. Here's Wikipedia, the People's Encyclopedia:

> In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas.

We'd have to discuss the Biogeochemical cycle but suffice it to say that the food we eat is made of it and it comes from the oceans and the atmosphere. Every breath we take brings in oxygen, a waste product. That's where we get all this energy to walk around and do stuff with.

> Well, I was 18 and didn't have a care. But I was leaning, solid everywhere.

Knoll begins to ask a bunch of heavy questions early on here. For instance, how to explain life on our rock (the third from the sun). What controls the composition of seawater and the atmosphere is another good example. But the most important thing to ask, according to Knoll, is how human beings are altering life on Earth via our own actions. Everything comes from the Earth but no one seems to care all that much. He goes on to discuss Boston (of course!) blah blah...

We read further down past a nice quote from a Senegalese forest ranger from 1968 about why we conserve what we love or some such and we then see why Knoll wrote this book: an attempt at understanding.

# 1: Chemical Earth

> Stood there boldly sweatin' in the sun. Felt like a million. Felt like number one.

13.8 billion years ago the "primordial kernel of universe began to expand rapidly" and is still. With the collapse of atoms into hot, dense balls due to gravity which caused hydrogen nuclei therein to fuse and form helium we have light and we humans now have something to look back to.<sup>\*</sup> Most of our understanding of things comes from light. Our eyes can only detect a narrow range of wavelengths but we have tools that can help us understand the composition of its source.

Quick, what's the speed of light?! 186,276 miles per second or 299,792,458 meters per second! - just as every schoolboy should know. Also, did you happen to know that when the sun goes out we won't know for around 8 minutes? 

Knoll has read Hawking and I think I heard it first from that English git in what undoubtedly inspired Knoll's title: [_A Brief History of Time_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time).

When we look up at the sky we're looking into history because the light has taken so long to get here. Wild. Just wild. What's even more insane is what we don't see. Dark matter and dark energy make up 95% of all that exists! This dark matter doesn't interact with light. Why? No one is certain. Well, someday! We humans are good at this stuff. Let's keep it up. We do know one of your namesakes lent a helping hand:

> [Rubin's calculations showed that galaxies must contain at least five to ten times as much dark matter as ordinary matter.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin)

Light, light on the brain. What's Hawking have to say?

> By the wave/particle duality of quantum mechanics, light can be regarded as both a wave and particle.

[Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck) suggested that light, X rays, and other waves could not be emitted at an arbitrary rate, but only in certain packets that he called quanta, mostly quoting Hawking.

Light and gravity.

> I still believed in my dreams! 

O, Bob! Hawking has me looking up John Archibald Wheeler but that's for another day and time.

Our sun has about enough fuel to keep burning and exploding for another five thousand million years or thereabouts. Think about time and its deep reach. How far back does it actually go? Knoll says this as "through the immensity of time". Time is big, Rex.
The early stars were great foundries fusing elements in the tedium of time overseen by vast nothingness. Eons of seemingly endless fusion. And and and and anything more?

<center>\*\*\*</center>

Much later, about 93 million miles from the newly formed Sun (Sol) and after all these collisions of atoms and the resulting heat and accompanying coalescing into forms we're left with some kind of Earth but not as we know it today, of course. Way back 4.54 billion years ago the Earth was not hospitable to life. I think we know this from rocks. If light is telling us the story of the universe than rocks tell the history of Earth so says Knoll. My mind wonders now to the [Cambrian explosion and the Burgess shale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgess_Shale-type_preservation) of which I learned from Gould and he has written a book called [_Wonderful Life_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderful_Life_(book)) all about it. I haven't read it all but do plan to finish some day. :-)

Soon we're talking about rocks from space and some even think that life came here from out there riding on a holy comet and boom landing on old Earth. This is called "panspermia" and Knoll says he understands that some others enthuse about this idea of seeded life (p. 72). Eiseley also discusses panspermia and seems more inclined on the idea but I think he calls it something else. He is far more poetic about it from what I recall. This doesn't really solve the origin of life problem, however. Just moves it elsewhere. This is all very great reading. This calls to mind [preformationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preformationism)—Gould has a wonderful essay about this that all should read called "On Heroes and Fools in Science". You can probably get all the Gould you'd ever need at Wikiquote: [https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould) but I might pepper him about now and then in what follows.

<sub>\* A star is formed when a large amount of gas (mostly hydrogen) starts to collapse in on itself due to gravitational attraction. As it contracts the atoms of the gas collide with each other more and more frequently and at greater and greater speeds—the gas heats up. Eventually, the gas will be so hot that when the hydrogen atoms collide they no longer bounce off each other, but instead coalesce to form helium. The heat released in this reaction, which is like a controlled hydrogen bomb explosion is what makes the star shine.  </sub>


### TODO

> God does not play dice

> Small bit more on quantum mechanics and key players

> Clearly more on Knoll since this post is suppose to be about his book.

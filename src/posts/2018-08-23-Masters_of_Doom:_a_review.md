title: Masters of Doom
---

Wildly enjoyable read. Made me wish I was born to a different generation. Alas! 

Summery: John Carmack and John Romero were two personalities that meshed well enough to produce a culturally significant video game. Things go well at first for their company (id Software), but clashes result when visions differ. 

The book itself is well written — a true page turner. One isn’t overloaded with too much tech mumbo-jumbo (there’s a technical [book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0768B3PWV/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0) written about the Wolfenstein 3D Engine if you’re into that sort of thing). The main players are vividly painted to reveal enough humanity to keep you — the reader! — going.

Highly recommended for first time readers of anything video game related.

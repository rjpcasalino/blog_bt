_Return to Castle Wolfenstein_ (RTCW) is a video game originally released in 2001 when I was 14 years old. Memory moves in one direction, time in another. It still plays like a dream and East Coast Gaming Network still thrives because [MAN-AT-ARMS](https://github.com/MAN-AT-ARMS) is still around.

This post is about iortcw and nix. What is iortcw? Id Software open sourced the RTCW code in 2010 and nix is ... nix, you should know what nix is if you're reading this, truly. Anyway, anyway, anywayâˆ’here we are in 2024 and RTCW still plays like a dream and it's time to understand it better and take a deep dive so that's what this is all about.

This is A Reminder to the nations

>And Ismail and Elisha, And Jonas, and Lot: And to all We gave Favour above nations:

>We also (sent) Lut: 
He said to his people:
"Do ye commit lewdness Such as no people In creation (ever) committed Before you?
For ye practice your lusts on men in perference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds."
>And his people gave no answer but this: they said, "Drive them out of your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!"
>But We saved him and his family, expect His wife: she was of those who lagged behind
>When Our Messengers came to Lut, he was Grieved on their account and felt himself powerless (to protect) them. He said: "This is a distressed day."
>And his people came rushing towards and they had long been in the habit of practing abominations. He said: "O my people! Here are my daughters: they are purer for you (if ye marry)! Now fear Allah, and cover me not with disgrace about my quests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man?"

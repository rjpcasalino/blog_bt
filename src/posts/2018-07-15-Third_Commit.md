*Lead, Kindly Light* 
by John Henry Newman

	Lead, Kindly Light, amidst th'encircling gloom,
	Lead Thou me on!
	The night is dark, and I am far from home,
	Lead Thou me on!
	Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see
	The distant scene; one step enough for me.

	I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou
	Shouldst lead me on;
	I loved to choose and see my path; but now
	Lead Thou me on!
	I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,
	Pride ruled my will. Remember not past years!

	So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still
	Will lead me on.
	O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
	The night is gone,
	And with the morn those angel faces smile,
	Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile!

	Meantime, along the narrow rugged path,
	Thyself hast trod,
	Lead, Saviour, lead me home in childlike faith,
	Home to my God.
	To rest forever after earthly strife
	In the calm light of everlasting life.

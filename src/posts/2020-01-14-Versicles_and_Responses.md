"...in the litany of life and in the special liturgy of Man: Vesicles by Adam, Rejoinders by the Crucified.

> We are the centuries.

> We are the chin-choppers and the golly-woppers,
and soon we shall discuss the amputation of your
head.

> We are your singing garbage men, Sir and Madam,
and we march in cadence behind you, chanting rhymes
that some think odd.

> Hut two threep foa!

> Left!

> Left!

> He-had-a-good-wife-but-he

> Left!

> Left!

>	Right!

> Left!

> _Wir_, as they say in the old country, _marschieren weiter ween alles in Scherben fallt_.

> We have your eoliths and your mesoliths and your neoliths. 
We have your Babaylons your Pompeiis, your Caesars and your 
chromium-plated (vital-ingredient-impregnated) artifacts.

> We have your bloody hatches and your Hiroshomas.

> We march in spite of Hell, we do <span>&mdash;</span>

> Atrophy, Entropy, and _Proteus vulgaris_,
telling bawdy jokes about a farm girl name of Eve
and a traveling salesman called Lucifer.

> We bury your dead and their reputations.

> We bury you. We are the centuries.

Or in more modern parlance, Vesicles by Thunberg and her "hot topic" enablers, Rejoinders by the aging masses assembled in palaces of steel.

> Get crazy
> Charge me and my family
> Charge me
> Charge me and my next of kin
> Charge me

> Charge me yes, oh yes, God

> Charge me you're a fooling dog
> Charge me
> Charge me 'cause I'll break a pause
> Charge me
> Charge me like a ...
> Charge me
> Charge me criminal at large
> Charge me
> Charge me can't get open doors
> Charge me
> Charge 'cause I have what's yours
> Charge me
> Charge me 'cause I'm feeling dark
> Charge me
> Charge me for stealing heard
> Charge me

> You know you'll never survive to judge me

> Yeah you judge me

> Yeah you judge me

> You judge like a God

> You know you'll never survive to judge me

> Yeah you judge me

> Yeah you judge me so hard

> You judge like you were a God

> You live in a glass house

> Yeah you live alone

> Like you were a God

> You live in a glass house

> Yeah you live alone

Aaron Copland and Billy the Kid and piano interludes <span>&mdash;</span> nice, nice since I have nothing better to say. Imagine now the fingers at play on the keys. Nixon, I am calling again, put those lanky piano fingers of yours into mine. Give me what I need. I am calling again, can't you hear? Where are you? 

It's resounding into the maelstrom with "Fanfare for the Common Man". Trust the star gazers. 

Remember the Art of Peace:
	
> As soon as you concern yourself with the "good" and "bad" of your fellows, you create an opening in your heart for
maliciousness to enter.
Testing, competing with, and criticizing others weaken and defeat you.

Remember!

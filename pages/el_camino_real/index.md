-- El Camino Real --

I am not a bad programmer. I had wanted to start this roadtrip with something "in my back pocket". It isn't there and that's ok. As the world gets older I just have to learn to dance with the currents of time. Again, that's ok. You know, it's all about the roll of the tires in the end. "If life is a highway than the soul is just a car..." as they say.

Perhaps I should timestamp these entries? Maybe "what a clock reads" is some dimestore novel so very worth a read. 

Trust that this is blasting along the Western Coast of the United States of America:

Play it load, they said. Let it fill the air, they screamed. Streaming downward toward the past it's a paddle to the metal type of race. Fists pump wildly as we ponder all the information. It's crowding our airwaves, they bemoan. Too late, too late, the experts shake their heads. Sure, sure we pushed it all very hard because the Cold War and all..., they will stamper on and on. Where are the flying cars? Thank God for the web, they will swing during holy revelations. Bless the Holy Wire, these strange-generations-yet-to-come laugh as they throw turgid cartoon yellow thumbs upon O' so many screens.

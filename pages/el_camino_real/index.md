They are melting these [bells](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7170313/University-California-Santa-Cruz-removes-El-Camino-Real-Bell-marks-inclusive.html).

I am not a bad programmer. I had wanted to start this roadtrip with something "in my back pocket". It isn't there and that's ok. As the world gets older I just have to learn to dance with the currents of time. Again, that's ok. You know, it's all about the roll of the tires in the end. "If life is a highway, then the soul is just a car", as they say.

This all reminds me of something some obscure politician once send when his mind was starting to fail him: 

"Play it load, they said. Let it fill the air, they screamed. Streaming downward toward the past it's a paddle to the metal type of race. Fists pump wildly as we ponder all the information. It's crowding our airwaves, they bemoan. Too late, too late, the experts shake their heads. Sure, sure we pushed it all very hard because the Cold War and all..., they will stamper on and on. Where are the flying cars? Thank God for the web, they will swing during holy revelations. Bless the Holy Wire, these strange-generations-yet-to-come laugh as they throw turgid cartoon yellow thumbs upon O' so many screens."

Lincoln City, OR is a [white man's dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl4lLfC8ZlE). An odd mixture of the types that flag as their banner (often attached to a big truck's hitch) an ugly hybrid of Old Glory and the Confederate battle flag. Yet, across the street there is an equally annoying reminder ("In OUR America, ALL are welcome...") that our Union is strained. 


Made my way down from Lincoln. The rest of OR coast offered stunning vistas. This views were made better by the fact that only Arthur and I were privy to them. Not a soul around on a Monday morning; all too busy in their metal coffins listening to the chatter chatter chatter blabber blabber sadder sadder. I don't think I took enough time to look out and gaze across the ocean and ponder things. I did not give myself enough time for that and one must make time enough for things one loves. My plan was to take in these vistas and read a book. Yet, whenever I drive I feel as if I am in a hurry. I was reading *Rabbit is Rich* the other day and there is a scene wherein Harry comments on his advancing age: While driving his car he wonders where all the young people driving came from. They often ride his ass (tailgate unknowingly) and make him nervous. He relates that he was that way as a youth too. Old people were everywhere then. Now, he really just wants to "let them pass". He also uses the word "cunt" far too much in his own head for my taste. I had forgotten how wonderfully real John Updike's words were. I also recalled the Italian *Futurismo* because their love of speed. They thought it was beauty. You know, I often forget I am of Italian heritage. Strange. And O' Umberto Boccioni. Wow. Wow.

And morning is here and Arthur refuses to down his "Crave" brand food. He is getting picky with age. My current vimrc isn't doing line wrapping like I wish it would. `set linebreak` fixes this. Today maybe New Mexico? I am not sure. U.S. 101 rolls on. I hope to get some pics posted today. Don't hold me to that.

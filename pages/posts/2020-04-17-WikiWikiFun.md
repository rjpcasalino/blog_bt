Remember stereo? Recall disco? Me neither. Well, I take that back. I remember stereo. I remember it well. The mind often wonders (wouldn't you agree?) back to halcyon days, salad days, and all sorts of days that remind one of golden sunshine and azure skies. 

Often I dismiss needless rememicances as I believe that forward movement is all that matters. Not so. I think it's high time we took a step back and maybe we'd realize that we're all in bondage to the foolish deversions of high minded men and women.

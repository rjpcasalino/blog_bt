One year!


<marquee>We made it, kid...</marquee>

I won't lie. It hasn't been a perfect year. There's been too many tears and not enough laughter. Laughter is the language of the soul.

What are moments of love? How would you describe them if some child were to ask?

I think I would say something like this:

> When the mere sound of someone's laughter makes one recall all that is good and decent in life / in an onrush from the rearguard all the memories of youth.

I had such a moment the other day, Anna. You mean so much to me. Without you days are aimless and the world is a bit more tame, less wild - to its detriment. Without your laughter, without your keen insight there isn't much worth anything. I've gotten everything I've ever wanted with you. And I know, from living with you, that something one wants is something one *needs*. O, I love you. I hope this an okay medium of reaching you. It's cheesy, I know.

I want you, I need you, and I will always love you.

My wife. I am a child before you. You tower above all others in my mind. I'm a pretty awful writer. This a meandering mess. Look at these artless, tactless phrases. Hackneyed, really! 

There is so much discord in the world nowadays. Anger all around us. Still, we want to bring a child into it. Can you imagine us in 5 years? I can see a very blurry motion picture and I can't discern too much, but I hope it's full of moments of happiness and joy. There will be memories we'll cherish and hold throughout our wandering days. My face is getting older, but I don't think my luck will change. I *hope* it doesn't. I love you relentlessly, wife.

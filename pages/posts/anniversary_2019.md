One year!


<marquee>We made it, kid...</marquee>

I won't lie. It hasn't been a perfect year. There's been too many tears and not enough laughter. Laughter is the language of the soul.

What are moments of love? How would you describe them if some child were to ask?

I think I would say something like this:

> When the mere sound of someone's laughter makes one recall all that is good and decent in life / in an onrush from the rearguard all the memories of youth.

I had such a moment the other day, Anna. You mean so much to me. Without you days are aimless and the world is a bit more tame, less wild - to its detriment. Without your laughter, without your keen insight there isn't much worth anything. I've gotten everything I've ever wanted with you. And I know, from living with you, that something one wants is something one *needs*. O, I love you. I hope this an okay medium of reaching you. It's cheesy, I know.

<marquee>la de da...</marquee>

I want you, I need you, and I will always love you.

My wife. I am a child before you. You tower above all others in my mind. I'm a pretty awful writer. This a meandering mess. Look at these artless, tactless phrases. Hackneyed, really! 

There is so much discord in the world nowadays. Anger all around us. Still, we want to bring a child into it. Can you imagine us in 5 years? I can see a very blurry motion picture and I can't discern too much, but I hope it's full of moments of happiness and joy. There will be memories we'll cherish and hold throughout our wandering days. My face is getting older, but I don't think my luck will change. I *hope* it doesn't. 

I love you relentlessly, wife.

You and our pets (babies, *animals*) are paradise to me. I want to make you happy. I want our children to grow up free and wise. I want to make love to you in a beach house we own. It would be a pretty lavish place with all the modern amenities.

>If sex were all, then every trembling hand
Could make us squeak, like dolls, the wished-for words.
But note the unconscionable treachery of fate,
That makes us weep, laugh, grunt and groan, and shout
Doleful heroics, pinching gestures forth
From madness or delight, without regard
To that first, foremost law. Anguishing hour!
Last night, we sat beside a pool of pink,
Clippered with lilies scudding the bright chromes,
Keen to the point of starlight, while a frog
Boomed from his very belly odious chords.

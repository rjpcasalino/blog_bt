title: 'New Dark Age Highlights'
---

I try to read as much I can. I have a Kindle that contains some of "my" books. Everything you highlight or take note of on the Kindle
is sent to an Amazon server (probably in Virginia). I assume they then have some software query over it all in order to build a better
consumer profile. 

*New Dark Age highlights*

- `immiserates`

- `progenitors`

- `The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age`

- `Vannevar Bush`

- `‘All stable processes we shall predict. All unstable processes we shall control.’`

- `Elizabeth ‘Betsy’ Stewart, of IBM’s Department of Pure Science.`

- `Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), the first company to manufacture an affordable business computer.`

- `Semi-Automated Business Research Environment`

- `‘code/space’.`

- `When an e-book is purchased from an online service, it remains the property of the seller, its loan subject to revocation at any time – as happened when Amazon remotely deleted thousands of copies of 1984 and Animal Farm from customers’ Kindles in 2009[.]`

- `Reading a book, listening to music, researching and learning: these and many other activities are increasingly governed by algorithmic logics and policed by opaque and hidden computational processes. Culture is itself a code/space.`

- `The aggregation of complex systems in contemporary networked applications means that no single person ever sees the whole picture.`

- `automation bias`

- `Contemporary information networks are both the economic and cognitive frameworks of society`

- `need to be more responsible about what we use the internet for … Data centres aren’t the culprits – it’s driven by social media and mobile phones. It’s films, pornography, gambling, dating, shopping – anything that involves images.’`

- `As in most proto-environmental claims, the proposed solutions are either appeals to regulation (taxing data), conservative regressions (banning pornography, or switching from colour to black-and-white photographs to save transmission costs) or hapless techno-fixes (like the miracle-material graphene) – all ludicrous, unworkable, and unable to think at the scale of the networks they seek to address.`


- `Such histories give the lie to the heroic narrative of history – the lone genius toiling away to produce a unique insight.`

- `The Web was necessary, and so it appeared – in this timeline, at least.`

- `future generations of transistors will take advantage of this effect to make chips the size of atoms themselves, while others predict a future of biological machines composed of DNA and custom, nanoengineered proteins.`

- `techniques is p-hacking.`

- `Data dredging`

- `overflow.`

- `upwelling`

- `the machine is chronicling its own inefficiency, in its own language.`

- `acknowledging grey areas of thought and understanding.`

- `variegated`

- `‘attempting to optimise a hidden utility model that the human experts may not be able to express explicitly’`

- `psychogeography`

- `‘the triumph of human capital over financial capital and real estate, capable managers over fat cat stockholders, and skill over nepotism’ is ‘largely illusory'`

- `In March of 2017, Amazon acquired Quidsi, a company that had built a huge business on the back of low-cost, high-volume goods such as infant supplies and cosmetics. They did so by pioneering automation at every level of the distribution chain, and removing the human in the process.`

- `As a result, Amazon employs a logistics technique called ‘chaotic storage’ – chaotic, that is, from a human point of view. By locating products by need and association rather than by type, it’s possible to construct much shorter paths between items`

- `obfuscate`

- `This debate between connectionists and symbolists was to define the artificial intelligence field for the next forty years, leading to numerous fallings out, and the notorious ‘AI winters’ in which no progress was made at all for many years. At heart, it was not merely a debate about what it means to be intelligent, but what is intelligible about intelligence.`

- `Friedrich Hayek`

- `Use of the software is illegal in Europe.`

- `Iain M. Banks`

- `Machines dreaming dream rooms where no dreams are dreamed.`

- `Catch-22 exemplifies the dilemma of rational actors caught up within the machinations of vast, irrational systems. Within such systems, even rational responses lead to irrational outcomes.`

- `baroque`

- `bifurcated`

- `‘The Year Without a Summer’`

- `National Radio Quiet Zone`

- `General Staff Academy` - Russian

- `The gray zone is the best descriptor for a landscape inundated with unprovable facts and provable falsehoods that nevertheless stalk, zombielike, through conversations, cajoling and persuading.`

- `AdSense` - Google company or software? Need to check

- `industrial model of entertainment production`

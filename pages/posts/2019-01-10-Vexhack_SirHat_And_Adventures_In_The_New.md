title: 'So Long GitHub, Hello sr.ht'
---

Recently GitHub added a new feature that allows one to attach a status
to one's profile (e.g., "Working from home", "Out sick"). Now, this is 
not harmful in and off itself, but it speaks to a larger problem on the
platform. Whatever happened to "Do one thing and do it well"?. This new status feature is bloat,
pure and simple. People I work with wouldn't use GitHub to see if I was
working from home nor would they use it to see if I were out sick.
It's a seemingly pointless feature. It's the last nail in the coffin for me.
I *loved* GitHub when it was younger. There was a
time when it tracked commit streaks, which is also useless, but I found it fun. It was back when
they were doing that sort of thing that I started to learn to program in
earnest. It was a scary time in my life. I was jumping into something I thought
I was ill prepared for. I have no CS degree and no formal training. I was
enrolled (i.e., paid to be part of) one of the myriad boot camps proliferating
around the nation at that time. I knew I knew nothing, but I was also sure
that I would be pretending to know something for the rest of my life. I still
feel that way some weeks. I don't truly understand half of what I do, but
I love it and I love the tools that I learned with. GitHub was one of those
tools. Yes, yes...Microsoft came and injected cash and talent.
It's the nature of the thing (this is a fond saying of mine because I lack 
a skill for written elegance).

As all these thoughts bandy about in the dome wherein my brain resides, I've
decided to abandon my old online moniker. "Gusbenz" was lifted wholly from 
someone I knew vaguely in elementary school. His "Gusbenz" was a combination
of his grandfather's last name and someone else he knew. One was named
Gus and the other Benz.The details are trivial and pointless. I stole the 
name and tacked on "3000". There were three of us back in the early 2000s: 
Gusbenz, Gusbenz2000, Gusbenz3000. I evidently became the sole owner later
in life and ditched the 3000. 

I view my username change as a renewal with tech. I am excited about what
the future will bring, while being sanguine about its prospects.

I've also started the process of moving away from GitHub. 
[sr.ht](https://meta.sr.ht/) is an open source solution that attempts 
to be a GitHub that isn't a GitHub. It harks back to the days of 
mailing lists. I was never part of that world, but I stood in
the penumbra. I want to be part of what it has become before it fades
away from this earth forever. The history of tech is long and it bends
towards irrelevance.

This post seems heavy on the ego, but I think it's stuff I need to get out
there. Getting older does strange things to your body and mind.

Long live Vexhack!

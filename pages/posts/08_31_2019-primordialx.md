You just cracked a joint and away we go. 

Recently I've abandoned desktop environments in favor of window managers (i.e., [i3](link)). There's a certain amount of freedom associated with getting closer to the machine, as it were. This largely involves stepping back in to time and utilizing the tools of yesteryear (e.g., xterm, xscreensaver, et al). There has been a certain joy in using these tools; tasks feel easier. I feel more as if I were an actual "keyboard cowboy". You know who I mean...yes, you do...hackers. Those pesky digital thieves, slaves to the electron and switch. This stepping back (nostalgia trap) has in*fested* my mode of thinking regarding the world wide web in 2019. JavaScript, once merely a jester manipulating, has become the king. JavaScript is the web and the web is JavaScript. Well, except maybe for all the `.jsp` and `.php` files collecting time on servers. Forget about those for a moment. Think only of JS. Think of Hackernews, think of all the coworkers you know that speak and write JS. They only care of JS because JS cares for them. This has become somewhat of a mindless and meandering rant. Going to stop that now and get back into what I was saying, which was something like this:

...hackers. Ellipsis and then the word "hackers". A hacker surely would use X11. We know what X is. Who are the new hackers? What are they working on? What do they dream? I hope they dream and complete. This seems to be my biggest issue as of late. I dream but I do not complete. So many projects stalled, so little actually getting done. I can rank and rave about JS and the "current state of the web" or I can get down and serious, si? 

Now take the task of migrating over all old blog posts from my earlier incarnations of boring tranquility. Methinks I should use bash? Well then how?

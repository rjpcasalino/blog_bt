> The net is vast and infinite

Where to begin? The story seems timeless at this point. Especially now when one begins to dust off
the various text editors to prepare for a resume update. There's a certain oddness when looking back
on aged (ageless) PDFs - seeing where one has been and where one is attempting to go. There's
often that nagging thought that one's own eyes are the only ones that will ever scan that employment
history. That's the nature of the "thing". That "thing" being jobs, people, airwaves, the fed, Mexican nationals, et al.

We randomly come to certain points in the infinite free flow of events, those mysterious phenomena. What propels us forward?
What yanks us back? What denotes success or failure? These questions are too large for this post. Much like the ethical
questions surrounding Harvard's endowment, and the coming migrant crisis at the Southern border of the United States.
Again, that ever present free flow of events; that vast cascade of information.

> Our paths still cross in these high pressure days, /
A crowd pattern will emerge /
Exchange phone numbers, wither away

Something is in the nadir of its existence. Following a fading light toward a dark and cold ledge. Waiting and
hanging - all alone. These are the types of high pressure days that one longs for. So far away - ephemeral.
Always reaching back for moments lost to eternity. Trying to feel things one can no longer feel. What is rebirth and renewal?
Who are we, where are we going? Tony Soprano once said this. He's gone now too.

We will begin again. The popular media of youth shapes and molds like a golem our minds. We strive to recreate what was once new, which in turn
strove for that very same thing. It begins again. Over and over. It is a pretty sight. Why does one think of [Final Fantasy VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VIII) at a time like this? They all were friends of mine; teenagers struggling against an enormity that they could not fathom. 1999. 9/9/99 - do you remember that ad too?

> I can hear you, the world hears you!

There is a William Basinski work called "The Disintegration Loops" - an amazing piece of American music. It ebbs and flows as if water lapping an
abandoned shore. It is a chill seeking warmth. In its attempts it falls deeper into that abyss of darkness. Vast coldness is death - an unavoidable
chariot. Music must always end.

As it is with music it is with an organized undertaking. The cacophony of a meeting disintegrates into a powerful silence. Cities rise and fall.
Kingdoms expand then wane. Micro and macro - it does not matter. It always begins again.

```
for (i = 0; i >= 0; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

There will be a stack overflow. Too much data to a buffer that cannot hold.

In the fast moving stream we glide. The greens and blues on either side blur as the blacktop stretches further toward the horizon line.
Reaching the critical angel of attack is almost angelic. Storage overflows with its contents vomited into the ether - the vast free flow of time of space.

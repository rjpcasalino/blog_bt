- Hong Kong protesters taking to the streets ahead of PRC National Day. Free Hong Kong.
- *Habeas corpus*  "recourse in law through which a person can report an unlawful detention or imprisonment to a court and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful."
- *The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (ねじまき鳥クロニクル Nejimakitori Kuronikuru)*
- Kenzaburō Ōe: harsh critic of Murakami
- I read Elmore Leonard's first four Westerns (*Last Stand at Saber River*, *Hombre*, *Valdez is Coming*, *Forty Lashes Less One*) over the summer. One even inspired my first Irish coffee. I didn't want to forget to write something about each of them. *Last Stand* features Confederates, Union men and strong willed women. The very notion of a Confederate hero now is unthinkable. *Hombre* is a great stagecoach drama starring a half breed Native American hero with an austere outlook on life and race. *Valdez is Coming* stars an uncompromising Valdez with a dark past forced out of his docile life of repentance; a Mexican-American hero our times are crying for. *Forty Lashes Less One* two minority heroes display resolve and magnanimity lacking in central white characters.

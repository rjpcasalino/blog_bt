Christmas is upon us! I think back to when I was a kid and eagerly awaited that day because it meant that either a new computer was to come or some new game system. In any case, those days are long gone. Seattle hasn't seen any snow yet and I've been walking around outside with a t-shirt on.

I recently read the first three stories in *[Exhalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation:_Stories)*.

I can recall them vividly, particularly "The Lifecycle of Software Objects" novella that resides in the middle of the book. Originally published in 2010, it's aged well. The male lead, aptly named Derek, is somewhat of a loser. He pines for Ana (our heroine) for nearly twenty years (I lost track while reading how years were actually passing in the story which might be the point?) and in the end does the unthinkable in an attempt to win her over. Doesn't work, who would have guessed? 

The outside world is rarely mentioned besides reminding us that it's gone to shit. Most of the action takes place in a virtual world called "Data Earth". Virtual worlds preliterate as time moves on. The steady march of progress continues regardless of those witnessing it wanting to partake or not. The novella has some thoughtful ideas about what the future holds for us, and I found myself actually pondering them after setting the book aside. Dopamine injected via headsets, robot bodies being inhabited by software, software saying "I love you". Some twisted world that will come to pass sooner or later. We haven't much of a choice in the matter.  

Besides that, I picked up *[Custer's Fall: The Native American Side of The Story](https://www.amazon.com/Custers-Fall-Native-American-Story/dp/0452010950)* from the library. Stay tuned for more on that (maybe).

one way to get and format file modification times in Python:

```
file_last_modified = os.path.getmtime(f)
formatted_mod_time = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d", time.localtime(file_last_modified))

```

Perhaps it's high time to document my readings / writings on the daily. I'm not sure
if I should post at the beginning of everyday with things I have read / written the day
prior or build this post up during the day and then post it. Ultimately, it doesn't matter.

- *The Verge* has a fascinating [article](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement) about the byzantine nature of Amazon's Market Place business. It seems that more and more people's livelihoods are wrapped in the behemoth's clutches. It feeds on the blood of citizens wanting what we all want.
- Started reading [The New Dark Age](https://www.versobooks.com/books/2698-new-dark-age) by James Bridle. Might be far too radical for me. Perhaps as I get older I am doing the reverse of what my peers would be doing (i.e., becoming more liberal). Too much fragmented information doesn't make humanity any smarter. It makes us dumb, makes us sad, and makes us feel very alone.
- Tucker Carlson [expounds](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/tucker-carlsons-galvanizing-speech/) on the state of our nation. We're less happy than we used to be (so says he). Materialism hasn't brought
about an enduring sense of well being that supposedly once was. *National Review* columnist thinks Carlson's speech will ignite a new "movement". I think that groundwork has already been laid.
- My boy David French [counterattacks](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/01/the-right-should-reject-tucker-carlsons-victimhood-populism/)!
- Reading Andrew Yang's [The War on Normal People](https://www.yang2020.com/buy-the-book/) - plugging Yang's campaign site here - it's been worth the time to read. Our country and culture is in a very precarious place. I know this because I'm in my 30s!
- U.S. Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell; State Rep is Reuven Carlyle and 7th District is Pramila Jayapal. Know this. Learn this. Think local, act local.
- [AOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez) blasted for dancing in her youth. Curious to see what she actually does as a Representative. Can't discount someone before they try. God Bless her in her attempts to defund ICE. Might be worth watching her speak while playing [*Young Dumb & Broke [sic]*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPfJnp1guPc).
- I fear my love affair with tech is cresting. I find myself reaching back while I know I should be far more aware of what I want to see in the future. Nostalgia is a powerful force. Our corporate masters know this better than anyone.

*UPDATE: 09/29/2019*
Well, that was a bust :)

Love at first sight if we're going to be perfectly blunt.

The Pig War was fought here and the Union Jack is still hoisted by U.S. Government employees. 

The still of the water and the grey clouds remind me of a security only found in the Pacific Northwest. Watching the Washington State Ferries come and go. All the passengers disembarking into the rudiments of Earth. One feels that there is a ersatz claim of fraternity with the land here. Primp mothers in luxury sedans scurry about with wheels turning on systems so above their understanding. Every effort to appease is blatant and worthy of sycophants. Still, these are the Americans. We occupy and develop where once there was no such occupation; no proclivity for change.

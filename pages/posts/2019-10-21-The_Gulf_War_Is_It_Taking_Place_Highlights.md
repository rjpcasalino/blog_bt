Jean Baudrillard is a recent influence; his secreted symposiums mark (*wet*) many a bush of my mind.

*The Gulf War: is it really taking place*

> "the professional and functional stupidity of those who pontificate in perpetual commentary on the event: all the [Bouvards and Peuchets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouvard_et_P%C3%A9cuchet) for hire."

> "[...] make us experience the emptiness of television as never before."

> "[E]veryone is amnestied by the ultra-rapid secession of phony events and phony discourses."

> "Or perhaps, with everyone glued at home, TV plays out fully its role of social control by collective stupefaction: turning uselessly upon itself like a dervish, it affixes populations all the better for deceiving them, as with a bad detective novel which we cannot believe could be so pointless."

> "Having assumed the Israeli style, the Americans will henceforth export it everywhere and, just like the Israelis did, lock themselves into the spiral of unconditional repression."

> "Clean war, white war, programmed war"

*The Gulf War Did Not Take Place*

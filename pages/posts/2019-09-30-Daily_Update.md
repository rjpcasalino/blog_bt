- [The New York Times Has Abandoned Liberalism for Activism](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/andrew-sullivan-ny-times-abandons-liberalism-for-activism.html)
> "Hence the insistence that everything about America today is related to that same slavocracy — biased medicine, brutal economics, confounding traffic, destructive financial crises, the 2016 election, and even our expanding waistlines! Am I exaggerating? The NYT editorializes: “No aspect of the country that would be formed here has been untouched by the years of slavery that followed … it is finally time to tell our story truthfully.” Finally! All previous accounts of American history have essentially been white lies, the NYT tells us, literally and figuratively. All that rhetoric about liberty, progress, prosperity, toleration was a distraction in order to perpetrate those lies, and make white people feel better about themselves. ... But the NYT chose a neo-Marxist rather than liberal path to make a very specific claim: that slavery is not one of many things that describe America’s founding and culture, it is the definitive one. Arguing that the “true founding” was the arrival of African slaves on the continent, period, is a bitter rebuke to the actual founders and Lincoln. America is not a messy, evolving, multicultural, religiously infused, Enlightenment-based, racist, liberating, wealth-generating kaleidoscope of a society. It’s white supremacy, which started in 1619, and that’s the key to understand all of it. America’s only virtue, in this telling, belongs to those who have attempted and still attempt to end this malign manifestation of white supremacy."

> "Dhaliwal was 42, a married father of three and a 10-year veteran of the Harris County Sheriff's Office. He made national headlines in early 2015 when the sheriff's office changed its policy to allow Dhaliwal to grow out his facial hair and wear a traditional Sikh turban while on patrol." 

- [CHASING A MEMORY: In California, orcas and salmon have become so scarce people have forgotten what once was. Will the Northwest be next?](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/hostile-waters-orcas-chase-a-memory-of-salmon-to-california/) [paywall]
> "Yet the matriarchs of the orcas that frequent Puget Sound still remember the big winter chinook that used to thrive here. The fat, juicy fish are precious winter food for orcas at the southernmost end of their vast foraging range. The orcas, called southern residents for a reason, cruise all the way to California to feed on Central Valley salmon runs. L pod was off Monterey early this year. The oldest whale among all the southern residents, L25, born about 1928, led the way. She brought her whole family because her mother did before her, and her grandmother before that. In the southern resident pods, the matriarchs lead the search for food — particularly in times of scarcity. But was L pod chasing fish in California — or only L25’s memory of them? The fish have become so scarce, it is hard to know if the whales got any nourishment."

- hmmm, seems I need to learn more markdown syntax to get the desired effect (quoting and paragraphs) 

- LEFT JOIN, INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN (Venn diagrams galore!)

- I've been thinking recently of writing a small cmd line utility with either C or Go.

- *China’s Influence & American Interests: PROMOTING CONSTRUCTIVE VIGILANCE* [Larry Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Diamond)

> "Although it was beyond the scope of our work to document in detail the political trajectory of the People’s Republic of China, it is critical to understand  that  under  Communist  Party  general  secretary  Xi  Jinping  China has become increasingly authoritarian and marked by rising lev-els of ideological indoctrination and control; diminishing tolerance for dissent; new crackdowns on human-rights lawyers; an unprecedented new assault on the rights of the Uighur and other Muslim minorities; and the emergence of a new surveillance state set on compiling digital profiles of every Chinese citizen with a “social credit score” that will dou-ble as a political loyalty index determining access to a wide range of ser-vices  and  privileges  in  Chinese  life.  For  readers  of  this  report,  it  is  critical to remember that the PRC remains a Leninist regime in which the Communist Party not only reigns supreme over the state at home but also now presides over a vast and lavishly resourced bureaucracy to project global influence, through so-called “united front” ties, to will-ing or ill-informed constituencies around the world."

I recently completed two books on my Summer Reading List 2018. I hope to share
some thoughts in the coming days. A friend of mine - or maybe just someone I 
know via the internet nowadays - shared Derek Sivers' [book notes](https://sivers.org/bfaq) 
with me. I hope to emulate what Derek has done and continues to do.
